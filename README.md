Marvin's purpose is to help your clan grow. He creates scoreboards and broadcasts clan achievements like hitting legend and those moments of luck where someone gets a raid exotic!

He can be useful for many reasons, if you are a clan owner and you feel like your clan needs a bit of spark adding Marvin can help increase the total active time your clan plays as it helps promote healthy competition and more chatter between clan members when someone gets something unique.

If people see that they are a few kills behind Rank 1 in the clan for a specific ranking, they might play more to get Rank 1 and keep that Rank 1 position!

Marvin is a great bot to have just to see who your most active members are, if you use the `~glory` command for example you might find people who you were not aware pvp'd much in your clan, so you could ask them to help you out? Or if you are curious who has or does not have a specific weapon you can use: `~item divinity` or `~!item divinity` to see who has what!
